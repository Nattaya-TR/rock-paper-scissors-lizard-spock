# rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock

After 2 and half week of Javascript exercise. Here come to my first javascript game.

I created this game when I study at BeCode in 2021. It's part of my project.

**How I make it**

In this project I wrote with <i>HTML, CSS and Javascript</i>. 

At very first I wrote it with almost 30 else if conditions, and it was finished fast, so I'm thinking to challenging myself a bit by writing new code with less if condition.

I watch some tutorial to get the idea. Finally, this game came up with using function to find the winner.

Here is how my web page look like
